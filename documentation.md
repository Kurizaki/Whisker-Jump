## 1. Information

### 1.1 Your Project

Whisker Jump is a copy in .NET MAUI off Doodle Jump. The main character is cat, who will jump on top of platform to reach a high highscore. Once the cat falls down, the game is over and the player loses. There might be the possibility oof a shop, in which the player can buy skins and items. The player will have to catch fish, since they will be used to purchase items from the shop.

### 1.2 User Stories

| US-‚Ññ | Priority     | Type | Description                             |
| ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    |              |      | As a ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. |
| ...  |              |      |                                         |

### 1.3 Test Cases

| TC-‚Ññ | Initial State | Input  | Expected Output |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1.1  |               |        |                 |
| ...  |               |        |                 |

‚úçÔ∏è The number follows the format `N.m`, where `N` is the number of the user story that the test case covers, and `m` starts from `1` and increments. For example, the third test case that covers the second user story would have the number `2.3`.

### 1.4 Diagrams

‚úçÔ∏è Here you can insert PAPs, Use Case diagrams, Gantt charts, or similar visuals.

## 2. Planning

| AP-‚Ññ | Deadline | Responsible | Description | Planned Time |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1.A  |          |             |             |              |
| ...  |          |             |             |              |

Total: 

‚úçÔ∏è The number follows the format `N.m`, where `N` is the number of the user story to which the work package relates, and `m` starts from `A` and goes upward in letters. For example, the third work package related to the second user story would have the number `2.C`.

‚úçÔ∏è A work package should take approximately 45 minutes for one person. The total number of work packages should roughly match this formula: `Number of R-Sessions` ‚ï≥ `Number of Group Members` ‚ï≥ `4`. So, if three people are working on a project with two planned R-sessions, you should have `2` ‚ï≥ `3` ‚ï≥ `4` = `24` work packages. If you find that you don‚Äôt have enough work packages, consider adding more "Can"-type user stories in Section 1.2.

## 3. Decisions

‚úçÔ∏è Document here the decisions and assumptions you made regarding your user stories and implementation.

## 4. Implementation

| AP-‚Ññ | Date  | Responsible | Planned Time | Actual Time   |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 1.A  |       |             |              |               |
| ...  |       |             |              |               |

‚úçÔ∏è Each time you complete a work package, record how long it actually took.

## 5. Control

### 5.1 Test Report

| TC-‚Ññ | Date  | Result | Tester |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 1.1  |       |        |        |
| ...  |       |        |        |

‚úçÔ∏è Don‚Äôt forget to add a conclusion that summarizes the test results.

### 5.2 Exploratory Testing

| BR-‚Ññ | Initial State | Input  | Expected Output | Actual Output |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | --------------- | ------------- |
| I    |              |        |                 |               |
| ...  |              |        |                 |               |

‚úçÔ∏è Use Roman numerals for your bug reports, such as I, II, III, IV, etc.
